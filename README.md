# Homebridge Alexa Smart Home

This plugin enables smart home device integration between HomeKit and Alexa which allows HomeKit/Siri to control smart home devices that are connected via Amazon Alexa.

This plugin **does not** allow Alexa to control devices in HomeKit. For that, please see the [Homebridge Alexa](https://github.com/NorthernMan54/homebridge-alexa) plugin.

## Compatibility

Compatibility is not guaranteed with HOOBS and I am unable to provide support for HOOBS users since I do not use HOOBS.

Node.js versions supported: 16.x, 18.x, 20.x

## Currently supported devices

- Lightbulbs
- Switches
  - HomeKit switches do not support brightness so any switches you have that support brightness will appear in HomeKit as Lightbulbs.
- Outlets + smart plugs
- Thermostats
- Locks
- Air Quality Monitors
  - Only confirmed to work with Amazon Air Quality Monitor. Please report an issue if it doesn't work with your air quality monitor.
- Echo smart speakers / Echo smart displays
  - Play + pause
  - Next track / previous track
  - Change volume
- [Request / vote](https://homebridge-alexa-smarthome.canny.io/feedback?selectedCategory=supported-device-types) on device types you would like to see supported.

## Features

- Devices already linked to your Alexa account can be integrated with HomeKit automatically.
- Only Amazon credentials needed to configure this plugin rather than credentials for all your devices.
- This plugin does not store your Amazon username or password. Instead, it uses session cookies that are valid for up to 14 days.

### Air quality monitors

All of the following are supported depending on what your device measures:

- Air quality score (Excellent / Fair / Poor)
- Particulate matter density (PM2.5)
- VOC Density
- Carbon monoxide levels
- Relative humidity percent
- Temperature

When you first add an Air Quality Monitor to HomeKit, the above measurements may appear in the Default Room but can be assigned to any room you choose.

### Echo devices

Echo devices appear in HomeKit as Televisions which enables media control via the [Control Center remote controls](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/use-ios-or-ipados-control-center-atvb701cadc1/tvos).

Echo devices are added to HomeKit as external accessories that need to be added manually. Restart Homebridge and review the Homebridge logs for a message similar to: `Please add [DEVICE NAME] manually in Home app. Setup Code: xxx-xx-xxx`

To use the Control Center remote controls, follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/use-ios-or-ipados-control-center-atvb701cadc1/tvos) to add the remote to your device's Control Center. Once the remote is open, you can change the device you are controlling using the `âŒ„` arrow next to the device name at the top of the screen.

Remote control features - **you must start the media on the Echo (music, audio book, etc) before you can control it. It may take up to a minute for the remote to start working once media is playing**:

- Play
- Pause
- Next (right arrow)
- Previous (left arrow)
- Volume control (hardware volume buttons, a.k.a. volume button on the side of your iPhone/iPad)

Siri is not supported out of the box but I may be able to support in the future.

AirPlay is unrelated to Homebridge/HomeKit and needs to be supported by the device (the Echo). If you wish to use AirPlay, the best option is to buy an AppleTV or Apple HomePod.

## Initial configuration

The first time this plugin starts, you will need to authenticate using your Amazon Alexa account. Please follow these steps in order - screenshots included.

1. Verify that your plugin configuration is correct. Specifically, the proxy `clientHost` and `port`. The `clientHost` should be the same host you use to access homebridge. For example, if you access homebridge via the url `http://my-homebridge-server.local:8581` then `clientHost` should be `my-homebridge-server.local`. The `port` should be a different value from homebridge (not 8581). Restart Homebridge if you made any changes to the settings.
   1. ![config screenshot](./docs/img/1-config.png)
2. Download the Alexa app onto a device of your choosing (smartphone, tablet, etc) and sign in using the Amazon account your devices are linked to. Confirm the `amazonDomain` plugin setting matches what you see in the Alexa app. Go to Settings -> About, scroll to the bottom, and look for Host Name. The Host Names you see should end with the `amazonDomain` you choose in the plugin settings, it will not match exactly.

   2. <img alt="Alexa app host" src="./docs/img/1b-host.jpeg"/>
3. **This plugin may not work and support or help troubleshooting will not be provided** if you do not use multi-factor authentication / two-step verification or if you use SMS for the verification code. Again, SMS two step verification will **not** work. Please download an authenticator app such as AWS Virtual MFA, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator and follow the instructions to enable two step verification on Amazon's website.
4. Check the homebridge logs for an error that you must manually open the url to authenticate.
   1. ![failed to initialize screenshot](./docs/img/2-failed-to-initialize.png)
5. Visit the url in your browser to open a login screen. It is a real login screen proxied so the plugin can capture the session cookie. The username/password are not stored by the plugin.
   1. ![login screenshot](./docs/img/3-alexa-login.png)
6. Enter your MFA code if you have MFA enabled on your Amazon Alexa account. Again, the plugin does not store this value.
   1. ![mfa screenshot](./docs/img/4-alexa-mfa.png)
7. If successful, you should see a message that the Amazon Alexa cookie was successfully retrieved. If you see a 404 page, return to step 3 and start over.
   1. ![login successful screenshot](./docs/img/5-login-success.png)
8. The homebridge logs will also show a message such as "Successfully authenticated Alexa account".
