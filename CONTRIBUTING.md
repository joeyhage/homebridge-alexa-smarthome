# Contributing to This Project

We welcome contributions from everyone. Here are a few guidelines to help you get started.

## Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to propose changes to the codebase without access to the main repository.

## Clone the Repository

After forking the repository, you'll need to clone it to your local machine. This is where you'll be doing all of your work.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/homebridge-alexa-smarthome.git
```

## Create a New Branch

It's best practice to create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix you're working on. This keeps your changes organized and separated from the main branch.

## Make Your Changes

Now you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to make your changes in the editor of your choice.

## Lint Your Code

Before submitting your changes, make sure your code has been linted with Prettier and ESLint. This ensures that your code follows the style guidelines of the project.

```sh
npm run lint && npm run format
```

## Submit a Pull Request

Once you've made your changes and ensured they're properly linted, you're ready to submit a pull request. Push your changes to your forked repository.

```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Then, navigate to the main page of the repository, https://github.com/joeyhage/homebridge-alexa-smarthome, and click on the "Pull request" button. Fill out the form and then submit your pull request.

Thank you for your contribution!
